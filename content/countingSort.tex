\section{Counting Sort}

\subsection{Introduction}
\textbf{History:}
Counting Sort was developed by Harold H. Seward in the early 1950s, often cited around 1954. It is recognized for its ability to sort integers in linear time under the right conditions.

\textbf{Definition:}
Counting Sort is a non-comparison-based sorting algorithm that sorts elements by counting the number of occurrences of each unique value in the input array. It then uses these counts to determine the positions of each element in the final, sorted array.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The algorithm operates in linear time.
    \item Time complexity: \(O(n + k)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements and \(k\) is the range of the input values.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Algorithm and Implementation}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Determine the Range of the Data:} Sometimes min is assumed to be 0 to simplify the process.
    \item \textbf{Initialize the Count Array:} Create a count array of size \((\text{max} - \text{min} + 1)\) and initialize all elements to 0.
    \item \textbf{Count the Occurrences:} Iterate over the input array and for each element, increment the corresponding index in the count array. For an element \(x\), increment \(\text{count}[x - \text{min}]\).
    \item \textbf{Transform the Count Array into a Cumulative Count Array:} Modify the count array such that each element at index \(i\) contains the sum of previous counts. This cumulative count tells you the final position of each element in the output array.
    \item \textbf{Build the Output Array:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Traverse the input array once more, usually in reverse order to ensure stability (maintaining the original order of equal elements).
        \item Place each element \(x\) into its correct position in the output array by using the cumulative count, then decrement the count value for \(x\).
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \State \textbf{Input:} Array $A$ of size $n$
    \State \textbf{Output:} Sorted array $B$
    \Function{CountingSort}{$A$, $n$}
        \State $min \gets \min(A)$
        \State $max \gets \max(A)$
        \State $count \gets \text{array of size } (max - min + 1) \text{ initialized to 0}$
        \For{each element $x$ in $A$}
            \State $count[x - min] \gets count[x - min] + 1$
        \EndFor
        \For{$i \gets 1$ to $length(count) - 1$}
            \State $count[i] \gets count[i] + count[i - 1]$
        \EndFor
        \State $B \gets \text{array of size } n$
        \For{$i \gets 0$ to $n - 1$}
            \State $x \gets A[i]$
            \State $B[count[x - min] - 1] \gets x$
            \State $count[x - min] \gets count[x - min] - 1$
        \EndFor
        \State \textbf{Return} $B$
    \EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}

\subsection{Evaluation}
\subsubsection{Building the Count Array}
\textbf{Operation:} Create and populate the count array with the frequency of each element in the input array. \\
\textbf{Complexity:} \(O(n)\) \\
\textbf{Explanation:} Each element in the input array is processed once to record its frequency in the count array.

\subsubsection{Modifying the Count Array}
\textbf{Operation:} Convert the count array into a cumulative count array, indicating the position of each element in the sorted order. \\
\textbf{Complexity:} \(O(\text{max} - \text{min} + 1)\) \\
\textbf{Explanation:} For each value in the count array, we compute a running total (cumulative sum), which takes linear time with respect to the range of values.

\subsubsection{Reconstructing the Sorted Array}
\textbf{Operation:} Use the count array to place each element from the input array into its correct position in the output array, preserving their order (stability). \\
\textbf{Complexity:} \(O(n)\) \\
\textbf{Explanation:} Each element from the input array is placed in the output array based on its position derived from the cumulative count.

\subsubsection{Space Complexity Evaluation}
\textbf{Space Used:} \(O(\text{max} - \text{min} + 1)\) \\
\textbf{Explanation:} Additional space is needed to store the count array. Its size depends on the range of values in the input array (\(\text{max} - \text{min} + 1\)).

\subsection{Application}
Counting sort is a non-comparison-based sorting algorithm that works well for sorting integers or objects with small, discrete key ranges. It counts the occurrences of each element and uses this information to place elements in their correct sorted position.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Sorting Small Range Integers:} Counting sort is highly efficient for sorting integers or keys within a small, known range. \textit{Example:} Sorting exam scores (e.g., 0 to 100) or ages of individuals.
    \item \textbf{Histogram Generation:} Counting sort can be used to generate histograms or frequency distributions of data. \textit{Example:} Analyzing the frequency of words in a text or the distribution of pixel intensities in an image.
    \item \textbf{Data Compression:} Counting sort is used in data compression algorithms to analyze and organize data frequencies. \textit{Example:} Building frequency tables for Huffman coding or other compression techniques.
    \item \textbf{Counting Occurrences:} Counting sort can be used to count the occurrences of elements in a dataset. \textit{Example:} Counting the number of students who scored a particular grade in an exam.
    \item \textbf{Sorting Characters or Small Alphabets:} Counting sort is efficient for sorting characters or small alphabets. \textit{Example:} Sorting letters in a word or DNA sequences (A, T, C, G).
    \item \textbf{Real-Time Systems:} Counting sort is used in real-time systems where sorting needs to be done quickly and efficiently. \textit{Example:} Sorting sensor data in real-time for IoT devices.
    \item \textbf{Database Indexing:} Counting sort can be used in database systems to sort and index records with small key ranges. \textit{Example:} Sorting records by a small set of categories or flags.
    \item \textbf{Statistical Analysis:} Counting sort is used in statistical analysis to sort and analyze data distributions. \textit{Example:} Sorting survey responses or experimental data for further analysis.
    \item \textbf{String Sorting:} Counting sort is used in string sorting algorithms, especially when sorting by a specific character position. \textit{Example:} Sorting strings lexicographically or by a specific attribute.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Sort Colors}
\href{https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/description/}{LeetCode}

\textbf{Description:} Given an array with $n$ objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

\textbf{Detailed Instructions:}
\begin{enumerate}

\href{https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/countingsort2/problem}{HackerRank}

\textbf{Description:} Efficiently sort an array of integers using counting sort.

\textbf{Detailed Instructions:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find the maximum integer in the input array to allocate a count array of size \(\text{max}+1\).
    \item Iterate through the array to populate the count array with frequencies of each integer.
    \item Reconstruct the sorted array by iterating through the count array and appending each integer based on its count, ensuring linear time performance when the range isnâ€™t excessively large.
